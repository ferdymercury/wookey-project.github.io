Quick start
===========

.. contents::

This section describes how to build and execute the ‘blinky’ demo
on a STM32F407 Discovery board. It summarises informations thoroughly detailed
here:

- :ref:`dependencies`
- :ref:`build`
- :ref:`flash`


Pre-requisites
--------------

Install the dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To compile and to run the project, some dependencies need to be installed.
Please check the :ref:`dependencies` section to fetch them.

Fetch the project files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Once the dependencies are installed, create a working directory and then fetch
the project with ``repo`` ::

   mkdir disco407
   cd disco407
   repo init -u https://github.com/wookey-project/manifest.git -m disco407.xml
   repo sync

Build the firmware
------------------

Set the environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Set the needed environment variables by sourcing the ``setenv.sh`` script ::

   . setenv.sh

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
List the predefined configuration profiles ::

   make defconfig_list

Two demo examples are described in section :ref:`demo`.
To build the *blinky* project, choose the ``disco_blinky_ada_defconfig`` profile ::

   make boards/32f407disco/configs/disco_blinky_ada_defconfig

Build the binary files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Then, you can launch the compilation ::

   make

Flash the firmware
------------------

Once the firmware is built, you can flash a target board using the procedure
described in :ref:`flash`. Currently, only the **STM32 Discovert F407** is
supported ::

   openocd -f tools/stm32f4disco1.cfg -f tools/ocd_demo.cfg

Execute the new firmware
------------------------
Press the black *reset button* to reset the board. You should see the
leds blinking. When the blue button is pressed, the blinking pattern changes.

Debug
-----

Read the USART with *minicom*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The demo examples are compiled with output traces sent to **USART1**.
This USART uses GPIOs **PB6** (TX, transmit) and **PB7** (RX, receive).
You can connect a USB-to-TTL converter to read those outputs from your host.
At least, you must connect the **PB6** pin to the receive part of the
USB-to-TTL converter.

On Linux, the device ``/dev/ttyUSB0`` should be automatically created after the
USB-to-TTL is succesfully connected.
Then, you can use ``minicom`` to read the messages from the USART and to have
some insight about what's happening ::

   minicom -c on -D /dev/ttyUSB0

Debug with *gdb*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To debug the new firmware, launch ``arm-eabi-gdb`` ::

   arm-eabi-gdb

Then, inside GDB, execute the following commands ::

   target extended-remote 127.0.0.1:3333
   mon reset halt
   symbol-file build/armv7-m/32f407discovery/kernel/kernel.fw1.elf
   b main
   c

Going further
-------------
Read the :ref:`demo` section that roughly describes the user code
executed by the tasks. You can adapt it to run your own examples.

Troubleshooting
---------------
If you any problem while trying to build a new demo firmware, be sure that you
have carefully read the following:

- :ref:`dependencies`
- :ref:`build`
- :ref:`flash`
- :ref:`debug`
