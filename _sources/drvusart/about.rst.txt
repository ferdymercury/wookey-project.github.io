About the Hash driver
---------------------

Principles
""""""""""

STM32F4xx SoCs support up to 6 U(S)ART devices, including 4 potentially synchronous serial devices (USART1, 2, 3, 6) and 2 asynchronous UARTs (4 and 5).

These devices have to be connected to the external world through 2 GPIOs ports. The GPIO backend connection depends on the board HW design and is a part of the
driver that is considered as generated by the SDK. See tataouine memory layout informations to understand how the board-specific parts of the drivers are handled.

In the USART driver case, the following are included to get back the board configuration::

   #include "generated/usart1.h"
   #include "generated/usart2.h"
   #include "generated/usart3.h"
   #include "generated/uart4.h"
   #include "generated/uart5.h"
   #include "generated/usart6.h"


This driver does not take any consideration on the way the device will be used, leaving the task handling the serial in various contexts, including serial console, serial interface to external devices (e.g. ISO7816 serial interface) or any other type of serial communication.
